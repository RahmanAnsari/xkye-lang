**Xkye** (pronounced: **/skaÉª/**) is an Open source, minimal, keyword less configuration file language that consists of text-based content with a structure and syntax comprising majorly key-value pairs. Thus the name **Xkye** is the anagram of the word **key-x** denoting keys which can have any values. These files can be used to store and retrieve individual or group of configuration settings for any application development. The **Xkye** file will go generally with the file extention **.xye**.

Xkye was created as an extended version of ***.ini*** format with more flexibility over reusing the ***entities*** and the group of entities called ***clutches***.

## Status
***Xkye*** is currently in its 1st major version, I will try to semi-regularly introduces breaking changes. These changes will be usually fairly easy to adapt to. The up-to-date grammer file [xkye.g4](Xkye.g4) is included in this repository. You can use this file to generate the lexers and parsers for various languages using antlr4. 

## Demo
Below is the basic syntax of the complete demo.xye file with all its components,

![Demo File](images/demo.png)

The output of the above script will be
```sh
value
127.0.0.1
192.168.0.0/24
```

You can easily copy paste the code using the [Demo.xky](examples/demo.xky) file included in the repository

## Applications using Xkye
Currently various applications using xkye in the contexts of configuration are in development phases, one of such is [GrubChirp](https://github.com/grubchirp) 

## Upcoming features for V2.0
- Inclusion of import statement for multi file support
- Addition of escape character for better string manipulation
