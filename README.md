# Xkye

**Xkye** (pronounced: **/skaÉª/**) is an Open source, minimal, keyword less configuration file language that consists of text-based content with a structure and syntax comprising majorly key-value pairs. Thus the name **Xkye** is the anagram of the word **key-x** denoting keys which can have any values. These files can be used to store and retrieve individual or group of configuration settings for any application development. The **Xkye** file will go generally with the file extention **.xye**.

Xkye was created as an extended version of ***.ini*** with more flexibility over reusing the ***entities*** and the group of entities called ***clutches***.

## Hello, World!

## Demo
Below is the basic syntax of the complete .xye file with all its components,

You can easily copy paste the code using the [Demo.xye]() file

## Applications using Xkye
Currently various applications using xkye in the contexts of configuration are in development phases, one of such is [GrubChirp](https://github.com/grubchirp)
