</p>

**Xkye** (pronounced: **/skaÉª/**) is an Open source, minimal, keyword less configuration file language that consists of text-based content with a structure and syntax comprising majorly key-value pairs. Thus the name **Xkye** is the anagram of the word **key-x** denoting keys which can have any values. These files can be used to store and retrieve individual or group of configuration settings for any application development. The **Xkye** file will go generally with the file extension **.xye**.

Xkye was created as an extended version of ***.ini*** format with more flexibility over reusing the ***entities*** and the group of entities called ***clutches***. You can use any IDE or text editor to open this file.

## Xkye file extension rules
- Xkye files extension is .xky by default
- File supports UTF-8 encoding format
- Supports whitespaces, tabs and newlines ascii code
- MIME Format type - text/plain


## Build environment requirements

Xkye is built using antlr4, so in order to build Xkye lexer and parser for various languages you need to have Java environment installed.

### Java version verification

#### To make sure you have Java installed. Check it with

<br />

```sh
java -version
```

### Antlr4 Installation

We can install antlr4 using any of the following methods:

#### Using the package manager

Modern Linux distros already include a package for ANTLR

```sh
sudo apt-get install antlr4
```

#### Getting the Jar files

```sh
# Download antlr4 jar file to /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/local/lib
sudo wget http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar
```

You will also need to create a command file that will ease the call to Antlr4. Edit a file named antlr4 and write into it:

```sh
export CLASSPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.9-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"
alias antlr4='java -jar /home/rahi/Desktop/entityx/antlr-4.9-complete.jar'
alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'
```

save the file, and give it execution permission:

```sh
chmod +x antlr4
```

finally, move it to a folder in the default PATH

```sh
sudo mv antlr4 /usr/local/bin
```

For the complete instruction about the installation of above mentioned packages for other operating system, please find the official documentation of [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and [antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/) here.

## Building

You can generate the parsers and lexers for our xkye.g4 file using the below command,

```sh
antlr4 Xkye.g4
```

You can then use the below command to test each component in xkye language

```sh
grun xkye <component name> -tree
```

For more details, kindly check the official antlr4 documentation

## Getting Started
A basic **Hello, World!** program in xkye language can be expressed concisely in just one or two lines as below:

![Hello, World!](images/helloworld.png)

The output of the above [script](examples/helloworld.xky) will be
```sh
Hello, World!
```

## Format
Further details regarding syntax and structure of xkye language is explained in xkye's wiki docs.

## Status
***Xkye*** is currently in its 1st major version, I will try to semi-regularly introduces breaking changes. These changes will be usually fairly easy to adapt to. The up-to-date grammar file [xkye.g4](Xkye.g4) is included in this repository. You can use this file to generate the lexers and parsers for various languages using antlr4.

## Demo
Below is the basic syntax of the complete demo.xye file with all its components,

![Demo File](images/demo.png)

The output of the above script will be

```sh
value
127.0.0.1
192.168.0.0/24
```

You can easily copy paste the code using the [Demo.xky](examples/demo.xky) file included in the repository

## Applications using Xkye
Currently various applications using xkye in the contexts of configuration are in development phases, one of such is [GrubChirp](https://github.com/grubchirp)

## Upcoming features on or before V2.0
- Ability to add IPV6 address
- Inclusion of import statement for multi file support
- Addition of escape character for better string manipulation
